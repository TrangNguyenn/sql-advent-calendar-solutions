**About the Challenge**

The SQL Advent Calendar is a festive coding challenge featuring 24 days of SQL problems, hosted by Interview Master.
The program consists of three difficulty levels mapped to a three-day cycle: Day 1 is Easy, Day 2 is Medium, and Day 3 is Hard. This pattern repeats consistently across the full 24-day period.
