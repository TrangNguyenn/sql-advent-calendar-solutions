-- Title: Hot Cocoa Break Logs
-- Difficulty: medium
--
-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

WITH locationDetails AS (
  SELECT *, location_name
  FROM break_schedule bs 
  LEFT JOIN locations ld
  ON bs.location_id = ld.location_id 
)
SELECT log_id, cocoa_name, location_name
FROM cocoa_logs c
JOIN locationDetails lc ON lc.break_id = c.break_id
JOIN cocoa_types t ON c.cocoa_id = t.cocoa_id
